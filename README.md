mitoMorph
=========

**mitoMorph** provides a set of tools developed to aid with the analysis of mitochondria as labelled in light microscopy images. These tools are implemented as a toolset for the ImageJ/Fiji software.

## Installation
Copy the files **mitoMorph Tool.ijm** and **mask2convex_hull.groovy** inside the Fiji application directory. Specifically, the toolset file **mitoMorph Tool.ijm** must be copied in the subdirectory _/macros/toolsets/_ and the script **mask2convex_hull.groovy** in a user-generated directory inside _/scripts/_.

The tools depend on additional functions available by activating the [ImageScience](https://imagej.net/ImageScience) update site.
